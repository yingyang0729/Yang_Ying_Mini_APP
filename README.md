# Yang_Ying_Mini_APP

TODO: The repo is for level 3 Mini APP, which is finished by Ying Yang. In the repo, it contains all images, css file, html files, Sass files and JS files etc. 

## Installation
TODO: In the set up processing, it uses visual code for CSS and HTML5 and find ways on [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/). 
And the developer also uses [Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/ca_fr/).

During the processing of creating the CSS animation, Ying Yang checks many information. Those references include:[Images from JSON File in React JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWG1Ygt1k1k&t=398s), [How to fetch data stored in a json file ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6bLYYStZss&t=35s). However, Ying learned a lot from internet but she did not copy any code. She used knowledge from Professor Trevor'classtime. She also used Vue Router. The whole project is finished by her.

## History
TODO: 
The FIP project is finished by Ying Yang. As the only developer, I would like to explain the project.

1.	Set up the basic structure with HTML and CSS
2.	Add the fetch function with JS. This step is for fetching JSON files.
3.	Create a database on my local phpAdmin and export the MySQL table. The table contains all information of the JSON files
4.	Create a database on my hosting and Import the MySQL table into my hosting database
5.	Change the Connect.php files and Json.php. Add the password, username, url, etc.
6.	Fetch the files of MySQL table.

## Fix Problems
At first, the website does not show the fetch files. However, I solve the problems by below ways.
1.	Clean and reorganize the folders. I delete all the unnecessary files
2.	Keeping the name of My Database is the same with the hosting.
3.	Try many times to find the problems. 
4. I do not know whether the PHP files is right or wrong. So, I use the echo”<script>console.log(‘Debug Objects: 2’ );</script>” 
5. After I check it, I find my connect.php is right. Hosever, it is not responsive with my web. 
6. It also shows the warning about the connects.

8. I think the database is wrong.
9. I change a host.
10. I create a new database with the new hose.
11. It is successfully working. I can see all fetch files.
